Some useful tips for working with Android Studio v0.8.6

  1. Go to 'Preferences' (Mac) or 'Settings' (other) and update Editor->Auto Import to check all options. This resolves a number of class resolution errors due to missing imports.
  
  2. Manually set up the path to ADB for command line usage (e.g., by setting PATH env vars) if you prefer to use adb from a terminal for debugging etc.
  
  3. Use "File -> Invalidate Caches and Restart" if you run into compile or build problems after some change in your project structure or IDE environment. (This seems to be the equivalent advice for 'did you power off and power it back on' for many of the Android Studio issues)
